# Software-Engineering


As software engineers, our job is not just about programming and writing lines of code, we must also be aware of the larger context in which software and software systems are developed. In order to develop and build an application we must first analyse the problem domain, providing software (and design) solutions for challenges faced within the system to be developed.</br></br>
Working within a Software Engineering methodology is an important part of being a developer, understanding the roles and responsibilities within a software process allows you to understand the flow of an artefacts development. As such in order to write a critical reflection on the SCRUM methodology, you need to have been engaged in a SCRUM.</br></br>
For this assignment, you are to work within the constraints of an agile methodology, namely that of SCRUM. You will be assigned SCRUM teams (as discussed in Lectures and Workshops) and in these teams, you must ensure that each of you contribute to the roles that exist within this methodology. However, as is mentioned by the SCRUM process you can assume different roles at each iteration. Whilst this assessment is an individually assessed piece of work, the group work required in workshops is there to expose you to the process of SCRUM, which is a group based methodology.</br></br>
Artefact:</br>
You have been asked by a financial institution – ACME Shares Co. to develop a ‘Stock Market Trading System (SMTS) client’ that can be used to automatically connect to a Stock Market to buy and sell shares, making a profit if possible.:</br>
You have been asked by ACME Shares Co. to build the client interface application that connects to the stock market server, and must have the following requirements::</br>
</br>1) System must have ‘some’ form of user interface
</br>2) System must be able to connect to a stock market system (which is provided for you) 3) System must be able to buy and sell available shares
</br>4) System must have an ‘automated’ capability.
</br>5) System must have the following commands:
</br>a. List current owned shares
</br>b. List profit (all systems start with £10,000)
</br>c. Manually Buy and Sell shares
</br>d. Request current List of stock market shares
